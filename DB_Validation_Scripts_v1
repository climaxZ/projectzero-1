This file contains scripts required for DB data validation

1. Identify if any null primary keys exist across any table
select * from t_raster_master where rid is null;
select * from t_site where site_id is null;
select * from t_raster where raster_id is null;
select * from t_pixel where raster_id is null or pixel_x_id is null or pixel_y_id is null;

2. Check if any pixels are missing values
select count(distinct raster_id) from t_pixel where band_value is null;
2a. Identify sites and filenames with missing pixel values
select raster_id, site_id, filename from t_raster where raster_id in (
    select distinct raster_id from t_pixel where band_value is null);

3. Check if any rasters are missing filenames(needed to identify geophysical property)
select raster_id from t_raster where filename is null;

4. Check how many rasters are loaded
select count(distinct raster_id) from t_raster;
select count(distinct raster_id) from t_raster where site_rast is null;

5. Count distinct sites that are loaded. These can be validated against the output from python raster clipping scripts
select count(distinct site_id) from t_site;

6.Check how many rasters are loaded per channel
select count(distinct raster_id) from t_raster group by filename;
